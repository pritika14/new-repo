# window.fetch polyfill

The `fetch()` function is a Promise-based mechanism for programmatically making
web requests in the browser. This project is a polyfill that implements a subset
of the standard [Fetch specification][], enough to make `fetch` a viable
replacement for most uses of XMLHttpRequest in traditional web applications.
